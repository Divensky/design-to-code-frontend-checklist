# Design-to-Code Frontend Checklist
A design. A static picture. Let’s breathe life into it and transform it into a webpage. This checklist guides you through every step of the way. 

### 🚀 Who Would Benefit 
Anyone looking to transform a design into code. 

Even a seasoned dev might slip and forget a detail or two if they don’t create a new webpage every other day. Just open this checklist and let it guide you. 

### 🏗️ Helping a New Dev
If someone is crafting their very first webpage, direct them to the more detailed explanations of each step in my [blog](https://learntechwell.com/design-to-code-frontend-checklist/). 

### ⚙️ Usage 
This checklist is designed to give common actions for creating any webpage. While it covers the essentials, your frontend project may have more specific requirements on top of that. This checklist doesn't delve into every detail but rather serves as a universal starting point. 

For more specialized checklists, you might want to explore resources like [Front-End Performance Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Performance-Checklist) or [Front-End Design Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Design-Checklist). 

### 🟩 Why This Checklist
I used to work in book production QA. We were big on making sure each person on the line had a checklist and followed it. This eliminated 90% of QA issues. 

So when I transitioned into web development, I looked for a checklist like this and did not find one. So I created it myself. I hope it proves as helpful to you as it has been for me.
